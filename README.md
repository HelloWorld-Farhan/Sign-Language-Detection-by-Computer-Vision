# Sign-Language-Detection-by-Computer-Vision
The Sign Language Detection System is an AI-based project developed using Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to interpret hand gestures into readable text. The system utilizes Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow to capture hand movements through a webcam, detect hand landmarks using a trained deep learning model.
